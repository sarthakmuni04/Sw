# Sweet Shop Management

A complete management system for handling the operations of a sweet shop — including inventory, billing, customer management, and sales tracking.

---

## 📖 About
Sweet Shop Management is a project designed to simplify and digitalize the workflow of a sweet shop.  
Instead of relying on manual records, this system allows the shop owner to:  
- Track sweets and stock levels  
- Manage daily sales and billing  
- Maintain customer details  
- Generate reports for better decision-making  

This project was built as part of an academic/software learning initiative to demonstrate full-stack development and practical problem-solving skills.

## 🤖 My AI Usage

As part of building this project, I used AI tools to improve my productivity and documentation quality.

### Tools Used

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**
* **GitHub Copilot**

### How I Used Them

* I used **ChatGPT** to:

  * Plan the project structure (backend, frontend, database layers).
  * Draft and refine this README.md file.
  * Debug errors and brainstorm alternative code solutions.

* I used **GitHub Copilot** to:

  * Generate boilerplate code such as Express routes and CRUD operations.
  * Suggest test cases and form validation snippets.
  * Speed up repetitive coding tasks for UI components and API calls.

### Reflection

AI tools made a big positive impact on my workflow:

* **Saved time** by generating repetitive boilerplate code.
* **Improved clarity** of documentation and project explanation.
* **Provided multiple approaches** to problems, helping me choose the best fit.
* **Boosted confidence** while working on unfamiliar parts of the stack.

However, I ensured that:

* All AI-generated code was **reviewed, tested, and customized**.
* I did not blindly rely on AI — every suggestion was critically evaluated.
* AI was used as a **helper, not a substitute** for my coding and problem-solving skills.
